# meditation

I made this app during the #30dayschallengecode of the google developpers students clubs it is based on a tutorial given by the instructor. This is one of the work which help me learn a lot of things in flutter as SafeArea, Expanded, GridView, BottomNavigationBar, InKwell, ClipRRect etc.

Basicaly this app is a meditation app with a home page showing different activies like diete recommandation, kegel exercises, meditation, yoga. Currently it's just the meditation part which is working. And when we click on it a detail page appears.
